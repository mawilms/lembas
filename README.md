Lembas is a plugin management tool completely written in Rust for the game "Lord of the Rings Online". You may ask why we chose the name "Lembas"? Good question. For a succesful journey in LotRO you may need some plugins but definitely the famous lembas bread!

## Installation

We provided prebuilt binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS. These binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/mawilms/lembas/releases)

If you want to build this package on your own you can simply clone the repository and run `cargo build --release`. Keep in mind that you need a working installation of Rust on your computer.

## FAQ

### **_Wait there is already a plugin manager. Why should we use Lembas?_**

Yes. LotRO has already [LOTRO Plugin Compendium](https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info663-LOTROPluginCompendium.html) and it works fairly well. We just wanted to provide a more modern version with a small footprint and that runs fast.

### **_Why Rust?_**

I've built in the past small projects in Rust but nothing fancy. So this project is a learning experience for myself. I enjoy Rust and I love Middle Earth so why not combine both? :blush:

### **_Where can I find the configs?_**

The settings can be found here:

Windows:

- `%APPDATA%\Roaming`

Linux:

- `$HOME/.local/share`

macOS:

- `$HOME/Library/Application Support`

I want to especially thank [@13r0ck](https://github.com/13r0ck) and [@hecrj](https://github.com/hecrj) from the [Iced zulip server](https://iced.zulipchat.com).
