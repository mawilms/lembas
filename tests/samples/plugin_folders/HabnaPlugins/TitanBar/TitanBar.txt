To add a faction:
	- Add faciotn name in 'functionsCtr.lua' file in the "LoadPlayerReputation" function.
	- Add new faction integer into the "FactionOrder" array in 'main.lua' at line 20.
	- Change "maxfaction" value to reflect the new total of factions in 'main.lua' at line 22.


To add a new control:
	- Add 'en','fr','de' text
	- Add control in 'menu.lua'
	- Add control in 'functions.lua', in 'functionsCtr.lua', 'functionsMenuControl.lua, & in 'functionsMenu.lua'
	- Add control in 'settings.lua'
	- Add control in 'frmOptions.lua'
	- Add control in 'background.lua'
	- Add control shell command in 'main.lua'
	- Add control file in control directory


TitanBar workaround:
	- Unloader (In functionMenu.lua: line 290)
	- Reloader (In functionMenu.lua: line 299)
	- ItemUnEquippedTimer (In frmMain.lua: line 191) & (In functionsCtr.lua: line 74)
	- BIItemRemovedTimer (In BagInfosWindow.lua: line 127)
	- ItemRemovedTimer (In frmMain.lua: line 175) & (In functionsCtr.lua: line 57)
	- ImportCtr (In frmMain.lua: line 168 to 172)
	- OneTimer (In frmMain.lua: line 205 to 251)


TitanBar Known Issues/Limitations:
	- Player Location (Player location is not accessible in API. It's currently based on chat channel, so it will only work if any one of those channel is active: 'Trade', 'Regional', 'RP', 'OOC' or 'LFF'.)
	- Equipment score (Score based on item Quality & Toughness)
	- Equipment durability (Item min & max durability are not accessible in API. It's currently based on item wear state.)
	- Server Time is based on user defined GMT.
	- TitanBar set to bottom. It will be over UI element because UI element can't be moved in-game.
	- TitanBar auto always hide not working when exiting TitanBar menu. (when not selecting anything)
	- Auto sizing label & control is not quite perfect, some time as lot of space.
	- Icon are always in front (Turbine stretch issue), so moving other control over each other is not recommended.
	- Turbine points not updating when user spend some points in the lotro store. (Turbine points not available in API and no text in chat when spending)
	- Turbine.Gameplay.LocalPlayer.GetEquipment() not working properly again. (Turbine API issue)


TitanBar Future Enhancements:
	Add Mail notification when API permit it.
	Add Server connection when API permit it.
	Add item stats in vault, shared storage and bagpack when API permit it.
	Add Travel location when API permit it. (how many travel rations you have)
	Add Hunter's camp location when API permit it.
	Add Trader location when API premit it.
	Add milestone location when API permit it.
	Add mount list when API permit it.
	Add Monster play money when API permit it.
	Add kinship members and friends when API permit it.
	Add other medallion (of Dol Guldur / of Lothlrien / of Moria )
	Add an alarm function (Message will pop at certain time to remind user of something)
	Add House chest when API permit it.

	Try to change the game time update to a eventHandler (if possible)
	Broadcast control infos to selected chat channel (Meaby later if needed)
	

Requested features:
	by Amethadan:
		Q: I love the Ability to see my whole income of Money per Char and Day and the Complete Money i have on Account. Is it posible to do this for the other Things as Siegel, Medailon and Splitter too?
		A: Meaby in the future!

	by ocKyal:
		Q. Is there anyway for you to add Housing Chests to the storage modules?
		A. Sure, when available in API.

	by Thaodan:
		Q. Woud it possible to add a functions that displays online kinship members and friends on a tooltip that is display when mouse if over the entry in titanbar?
		A. Sure, when available in API.

	by MrsAngelID:
		Q. The ability to track other wallet items based on user selection (ie medallions of the north men etc.)
		A. Sure, need name in wallet API, i don't have that medallion.

	by DaemonSambe:
		Q. Have you considered individual fontsize options? I know i'd like it to set coin and inventory larger than the other pieces.
		A. Meaby in the future!

	by daimon:
		Q. How about /played ? I guess it would only work if the player would type it to get the info. Would still be pretty cool to get total played on all alts pretty easily
		A. I will not add this feature because I dont consider this info usefull!

	by spider_007:
		Q. If it's possible, could you add something, or make something that kinda does the same thing as the emote plugin, but a little more user-friendly?
		A. Meaby in the future!

	by DaemonSambe:
		Q. So, i think you could do more with the reputation control. It would be good to get the functionality we get in WoW faction plugins;
			Use the window box to display all the reps, without having to track a specific rep.
			Then use the bar display to track the recently updated rep, with session changes.
			So, if i just got 700 rep with Iron Garrison Miners, change the bar display to track IGMiners, with the value, and the session change total. Considering the limited space on the bar display, using shortened names values would be good; ie. IG Miners 7.3k/35k +2.8k. The window display could use the same treatment to save space. I don't know if you can do text colors, but that would be useful for setting the rep levels.
			Also, with the current version it seems that the hover display on the icon is dodgy. I can't always get it to display without pixel perfect alignment on the icon; seems to be the lack of text making it difficult.
		A. I will not add this feature because I love it the way it his right now.
